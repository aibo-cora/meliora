# Courage starts with showing up and letting ourselves be seen.

<br>
    This is a streaming app that is using a proprietary video streaming framework `Joint` - https://github.com/aibo-cora/joint-spm
<br>
<br>
This app is just a shell for now, proof of concept. You are more than welcome to contribute to this project or use this as an example to create your own amazing application.

<br><br>
<h2> Purpose </h2>
The purpose of this project is to bring developers, designers, sponsors, investors together to make an awesome streaming application, an environment where users decide what content is right for them. A community application has a much better chance of taking on some of the behemoths, because more creative ideas generated by the contributors and users will be adopted.
